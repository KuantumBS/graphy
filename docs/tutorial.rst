Example
-------------------------

Let's find a high-modularity decomposition of the karate-club network.
Boolean network are a type of discrete-state, discrete-time dynamical system.  
Each node updates itself as a Boolean function of other nodes (it's 'inputs').

:doc:`graphy.partitions` implements search over decompositions.
